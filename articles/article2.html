              Kamiana Mohyla (Stone Grave) - The Sacral Place of Power in

              14 million years ago Sarmat Sea retreating exposed the sandy hill
              which over time turned into a solid monolith. Under the influence
              of sun, wind and rain the hill began to crack. The big boulders
              slowly began to slip to the ground. As a result a large number of
              grottoes and caves formed in Kamiana Mohyla.
            </p>
            <p>
              These grottoes have always attracted people. Various ancient
              Paleolithic tribes, hunters of era of Copper and Bronze and later
              steppe nomads Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians, Huns and other
              tribes settled near Kamiana Mohyla using it as a sanctuary.
              Priests before each important event rose to ancient slopes to
              carry out magic rites.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 68 grottoes and caves of Kamiana Mohyla there is a large number
              of petroglyphic complexes - unique examples of primitive art. More
              than 3000 paintings from Stone Age to Bronze Age and later create
              a unique historical gallery. In this gallery there in Grotto Bull
              there are plates on which featured harnessed bulls, plate of
              traces with drawings of human dipes, horse plates with horses
              depicting the first riders on them in Europe as well as separate
              petroglyphs of carriages, boats, wild animals, solar symbols,
              scenes of hunting and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on scientific studies scientists have proven that Kamiana
              Mohyla is a powerful emitter of energy. On the top of the hill
              there are 5 stones with positive energy and only one - with a
              negative.
            </p>
            <p>
              At various times Kamiana Mohyla was visited by Supreme Lama of
              Nepal, prominent ocean explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau and other
              representatives of national and world elites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recently Kamiana Mohyla National Reserve became the real center of
              archaeological and historical science in Zaporizhzhia region.
              Every year starting in 1932 archaeological expeditions are being
              held here allowing to discover new monuments of ancient cultures.
              A unique phenomenon was the discovery of the oldest on Earth
              so-called "Proto Sumerian Literacy".
            </p>
            <p>
              Kamiana Mohyla is located near the Sea of Azov and has every
              reason to become an international center of tourism in the south
              of Ukraine.
