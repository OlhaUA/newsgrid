            <p>
              <span class="about-ua">What I love</span> – My name is Inna
              Samoilova. I am the founder of the
              <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>

                >Online School of Ukrainian Language</a
              >! I am a native of Ukraine. I was born and raised here. I speak
              formal Ukrainian, as well as, the regional variations. I am also
              fluent in Russian, English and German. But Ukrainian is my native
              language and of course my favorite! I love this language and
              culture so much that I want to share it with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="about-ua">About myself</span> – I possess both a
              Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree in Linguistics. I have held
              teaching positions in language schools in Ukraine and abroad. I
              have been teaching Ukrainian using the internet as a video-based
              medium for over four years. I have taught more than 130 students
              from 24 nations around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="about-ua">About you</span> – I know from personal
              experience the difficulties of learning a foreign language on your
              own. That is why I created this online school. Introducing a new
              teaching model – an online, multimedia platform where you can
              study the beautiful Ukrainian language and interact with qualified
              and trained instructors that I have chosen based on their
              expertise and teaching experience. We have prepared for you many
              useful learning materials that you will find online, including
              video lessons, and my newly published book, “Master Ukrainian
              cases: Tables and Exercises”.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="about-ua">What you will get</span> – Based on my
              years of experience with foreign students, I have created
              customized courses with all the “tips and tricks” you need to
              avoid the common pitfalls and make your Ukrainian language
              learning journey successful. I have worked very hard for you – to
              create the best online Ukrainian language resource possible, so
              you can spend less time on study and more time on what matters to
              you the most. Discover the rich beauty of this historic language
              and fall in love with it as much as I do!
