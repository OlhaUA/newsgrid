              Bermet Talant, a Kyrgyz journalist based in Kyiv (Ukraine) noted
              that "In Russia, a state that still takes pride in the Soviet
              legacy, the series has faced criticism from the official media.
              Meanwhile, many in Ukraine appreciated the series for humanizing a
              tragic chapter in the country’s history. Ukrainian viewers also
              appreciated HBO’s “Chernobyl” for praising the heroism and
              self-sacrifice of ordinary people."
            </p>
            <p>
              Belarusian Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich, whose book inspired
              the series, said "We are now witnessing a new phenomenon that
              Belarusians, who suffered greatly and thought they knew a lot
              about the tragedy, have completely changed their perception about
              Chernobyl and are interpreting this tragedy in a whole new way.
              The authors accomplished this, even though they are from a
              completely different world – not from Belarus, not from our
              region." She also noted its popularity with young Belarusians.

              The five-part series premiered in the United States on May 6,
              2019, and concurrently in the United Kingdom on May 7, to
              widespread critical acclaim. At the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, it
              received nineteen nominations and won for Outstanding Limited
              Series, Outstanding Directing, and Outstanding Writing, while
              Harris, Skarsgård, and Watson received acting nominations. At the
              77th Golden Globe Awards, the series won for Best Miniseries or
              Television Film and Skarsgård won for Best Supporting Actor in a
              Series, Miniseries or Television Film.
