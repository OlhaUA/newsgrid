              Where Do You See Yourself In 5 Years and What Are You Doing?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I see myself being one of the biggest resources for online
              education both on <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA"
                target="_blank"
                >YouTube</a
              >
              as well as premium platforms like Udemy.
            </p>
            <p>
              I see myself learning more including new languages (C#, Rust, C++)
              as well as new frameworks and new concepts like Machine Learning
              and AI. I also have a few ideas for side projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              As far as what I am doing now, of course the YouTube channel is a
              huge priority. I try and do a video a few times per week. I am
              working on a Python Django project based Udemy course and have
              future courses planned for Vue.js, React Native, a web dev starter
              course and more.

            <h3>Your 5 Tips for Someone New to Web Development:</h3>
            <p>
              <ol>
              <li>
                Try not to get overwhelmed: There is a TON of information out
                there as well as languages, frameworks, etc. Take your time
                looking at each one and find something you have a knack for. It
                could be frontend, backend/database, full stack. Find what you
                are most interested in most and stick with it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do not get discouraged and feel like you do not belong:
                Development is hard. It takes a lot of time and effort to wrap
                your head around many concepts. You may feel stupid at times, I
                know I have over and over. Even the best programmers in the
                world had areas of struggle. Work through it and do not give up.
                If other programmers are disrespectful and make you feel dumb,
                ignore them and just know they have self-confidence issues
                themselves and that‚Äôs why they do that.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don‚Äôt get caught up in ‚Äúlatest trends‚Äù: Trends change almost
                daily. Find something you love. I‚Äôm not saying pay no attention
                to what‚Äôs hot and what‚Äôs not, but do not make your decision on
                what you want to do based on that alone. Many people do and it‚Äôs
                unfortunate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Code everyday but also take breaks: I think everyone should code
                everyday, whether it is a tutorial or your own project or even
                just reading articles about development. At the same time, it is
                important to take a break: get up and stretch, go for a walk and
                refresh your brain.
              </li>
              <li>
                Build your own projects: Tutorials and courses are great, but
                you can only learn so much following a tutorial. Take what you
                learn from those tutorials and create your own stuff. You will
                learn how to think critically and solve problems much more than
                you would in a tutorial. Tutorials are important though,
                especially mine üòä (just kidding).
