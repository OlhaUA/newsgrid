              On the banks of the Prypiat River lies a forest. On a crisp winter
              afternoon with an expansive blue sky above and hardened snow
              underfoot, the area is criss-crossed with the tracks of hares,
              deer and wolves. This is the south-eastern tip of Belarus, home to
              sleepy villages steeped in tradition, where people hang their
              Christmas trees upside-down from the ceiling and eat raw pig fat
              as an afternoon snack. It is also part of Polesia, Europe’s
              largest wilderness. More than two-thirds the size of the UK (18m
              hectares) and spread across Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia,
              in spring this brittle landscape blooms into a labyrinth of
              gigantic bogs and swamps that supports large populations of
              wolves, bison, lynx and 1.5 million migratory birds. It has been
              called “the Amazon of Europe” for its extraordinary biodiversity.

              However, unlike its Brazilian cousin, this region is not
              best-known for its wildlife but something more sinister. In April
              1986 this forgotten part of the Soviet Union made headlines after
              reactor 4 of the Chornobyl power plant blew up. The explosion cast
              a long shadow over Belarus, which absorbed 70% of the escaped
              radiation, making it one of the most contaminated places on Earth.
              Now another catastrophe could be about to befall its people: the
              construction of the E40 waterway, a 2,000km (1,240-mile) inland
              shipping route linking the Black Sea and the Baltic that would
              slice through the wilderness and involve dredging inside the
              Chornobyl exclusion zone. Experts say this will destroy vast
              ecosystems and stir up radioactive sludge that accumulated on the
              bottom of the river following the explosion, potentially
              contaminating the drinking water of millions of people.
