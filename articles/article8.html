              Servant Of The People, a sharp-edged comedy, first aired in 2015.
              Zelenskiy stars as high-school teacher Vasyl Holoborodko, whose
              classroom tirade against corruption is filmed by a pupil and
              posted online, propelling him to the presidency after the post
              goes viral. Think Yes Minister crossed with House Of Cards,
              transposed on to the grimly cynical world of post-Soviet politics.
              The popularity of the show prompted a question, backed up by
              favourable polling numbers: what if Zelenskiy ran for office in
              real life? In the final moments of 2018, on his new year
              television show, he announced that he would.
            </p>
            <p>
              He ran a ludicrous, postmodern campaign, the centrepiece of which
              was a nationwide comedy tour that included video clips of his
              on-screen president. Mainly, he just wanted to make the audience
              laugh. One Ukrainians-on-holiday sketch poked fun at a tourist who
              spends his vacation watching movies on a bus. “But where did you
              stop?” he is asked. “Somewhere around Terminator 2,” comes the
              response.
            </p>
            <p>
              Zelenskiy was up against the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko, a
              billionaire chocolate magnate who had won the presidency a few
              months after the Maidan revolution. While Poroshenko had brought
              some reform, he had failed to deliver on his key promise to end
              corruption. Lagging in the polls, he was flummoxed by Zelenskiy’s
              insurgent campaign, and tried to paint his opponent as a man who
              would appease Putin over the war. Meanwhile Zelenskiy largely
              avoided debate, running a populist campaign – the people against
              the old elites – but without the usual populist tactic of sowing
              anger and division. Instead, he made vague talk of unification,
              fighting corruption and ending the war, with few specifics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that Zelenskiy is in charge, does he regret mocking
              politicians so mercilessly on his TV show? Zelenskiy smiles. "I
              understood that, without experienced people it’s impossible to run
              a country. But these people are at middle level. They are the
              bureaucrats who know where to scurry to, what to do, whom to bring
              the papers to". Zelenskiy claimed to us that because he and his
              circle are demonstrably not on the take, it has become more
              difficult for anyone else to take a bribe. "The president can’t
              change the country on his own. But what can he do? He can give an
              example".
